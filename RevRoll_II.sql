Question #4: 


Write a solution to calculate the cumulative part summary for every part that 
the RevRoll team has installed.


The cumulative part summary for an part can be calculated as follows:


- For each month that the part was installed, 
sum up the price*quantity in **that month** and the **previous two months**. 
This is the **3-month sum** for that month. 
If a part was not installed in previous months, 
the effective price*quantity for those months is 0.
- Do **not** include the 3-month sum for the **most recent month** that the part was installed.
- Do **not** include the 3-month sum for any month the part was not installed.


Return the result table ordered by `part_id` in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by `month` in descending order. Limit the output to the first 10 rows.
